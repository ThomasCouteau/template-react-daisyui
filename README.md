# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This template uses ReactJS and DaisyUI for styling with TailwindCSS. It also includes react-router-dom for routing.
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) is a component library for TailwindCSS
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is a declarative routing library for React
